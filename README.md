**modules/** is where I keep custom ansible module(s)
#####in progress:
-  **defaults:** an attempt to stop wrapping ``command: /usr/bin/defaults`` with something a little nicer.  it works. for me. so far.  I guess.  no guarantees.  it really just wraps the defaults binary right now, ideally it'd use [FoundationPlist.py](https://code.google.com/p/munki/source/browse/code/client/munkilib/FoundationPlist.py) but that's beyond me at the moment.


----------

**playbooks/** are mostly a mess of bits that could be "- include:"ed in all.yml, useful for testing.  for me at least.

----------

**roles/** my custom [osxc](http://osxc.github.io) roles
I've been working on trying to document full options with example playbook use for roles in role/foo/README.md

#####working:
-   **ansible\_vars:** dump all of ansible's available variables.
-   **bare\_role:** a basic empty role for copying when starting a new one.
-   **check\_os\_vers:** example of how to test for Mt Lion or Mavericks or Yosemite.
-   **computername:** sets the Computer Name normally done via System Prefences \- Sharing.
-   **datetime:** sets time zone, enable/disable network time, network time server and menubar clock options equivalent to System Preferences - Date & Time
-   **desktop\_image** sets the User's desktop picture via [set_desktops.py](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/macscripts/set_desktops/set_desktops.py), supports an image in xc-custom or a http(s) url.
-   **finder\_prefs:** sets a bunch of Finder preferences normally done via Finder's Pref Pane.
-   **finder\_window\_prefs:**  sets a bunch of Finder preferences normally done via the Menubar.
-   **gatekeeper:** enable or disable GateKeeper system wide via spctl.
-   **googlefonts:** downloads and installs selected fonts from [googlefontdirectory](https://github.com/w0ng/googlefontdirectory).
-   **locatedb:** load or unload locatedb via launchctl.
-   **macports_install:** downloads and installs the correct pkg of macports for current OS version.
-   **macports_package:** wraps ansible's builtin macports module.
-   **sleep:** set various sleep times for Disks, Display, System via systemsetup and pmset.
-   **sshd:** enable or disable sshd via systemsetup.
-   **systemprefs\_general:** sets prefs normally done via System Preferences \- General.
-   **systemprefs\_sound:** sets a few system volume options normally done via System Preferences \- Sound.
-   **unhide\_library:** unhides ~/Library in Finder.

#####in progress:
-   **autopkg\_install:** downloads and installs autopkg directly from github including specifying your own choices of repos.
-   **autopkg\_repo:** add recipe repos to autopkg.
-   **autopkg\_run:** performs an 'autopkg run foo foo2'.
-   **dock1010:** downloads, installs and uses a patched dockutil for Yosemite
-   **munki\_client:** sets up a new munki client from above.  no https yet.
-   **munki\_client\_pkgr:** builds a munki client pkg for an osxc installed/managed repo.
-   **munki\_iconimport:** ensures munki's iconimporter is present and runs to import icons into the repo.
-   **munki\_manifest:** wraps 'manifestutil add-pkg' works really well with autopkg\_run to automagically create and populate a munki repo and generate a manifest with those items.
-   **munki\_repo:** sets up minimal directory structure for a munki repo.  only os x client & server so far.
-   **munkitools:** downloads and installs munkitools from pkg or dmg, even specific build versions and custom urls if specified.  no https yet.
-   **sal** downloads, configures, installs and starts up [sal](https://github.com/grahamgilbert/sal) for OS X and some rough bits to deploy on linux as well (untested).  does everything but set the admin passwd, for now.
-   **example:** is an attempt at slapping together something simple illustrating some of the basic but extremely useful/common building blocks of an ansible/osxc role.

#####broken:
-   **desktop\_view\_opts:** is a severly broken attempt to set some Finder window prefs (only TB Display Mode works)
-   **terminal\_prefs:** an attempt to install and configure Terminal.app prefs.  install: works, setting the prefs and having them stick with Terminal.app running?  not so much. so it's very sketchy to use in a playbook run from within Terminal.app since it will aggressively kill Terminal.app in order to make the prefs stick.  yuck.

----------

**scripts/** are mostly bits to forcibly delete things when I'm developing/testing roles.  not very interesting or useful and certainly don't use on your own machine and blame me if your computer explodes in a giant fireball of doom.

**ninjastar.jpg** is both for this [README.md](README.md) and my contributed [user_image role](https://github.com/osxc/xc-common/tree/master/roles/user_image/) in [xc-common](https://github.com/osxc/xc-common).
